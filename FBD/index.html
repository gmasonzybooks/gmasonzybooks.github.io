  <h3>Graphing tool based on Konva.js that uses XML from the Animator to inputs.</h3>
 <p> Accessibility feature:<br/>
 Double click on the curve or vector to open a dialog box for entering values directly.<br/>
 The Curve dialog is not implemented.<br/>
 The Vector dialog shows how you could let users who were visually impared position vectors. The point locations were created in the Animator tool (see the XML). This aproach works for 2D and 3D images. The issue with 3D is that there are multiple 3D directions that give the same 2D projection.  There may be workarounds or maybe it doesn't matter.
