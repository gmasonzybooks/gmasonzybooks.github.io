  <h3>Concepts.</h3>

 <br/>
 <h3>Original approach that imports layouts using a SVG library.</h3>
   <a href="index rocker.html">Rocker - add FBD vectors</a>
  <a href="index beam.html">Beam - outline beam and draw FBD vectors</a>
  <a href="index VM.html">VM Diagram - draw V(x) and M(x)</a>

  <a href="index projectile.html">Projectile - draw projectile's path</a>
  <a href="index circuits.html">Circuits - place resistors (author created png)</a>
 <h3>Updated approach that uses the Animation Builder for creating layouts.</h3>
   <a href="../FBDAnimator/index.html">Simply support beam VM diagram</a>
  <a href="../FBDAnimator/index copy.html">Partial rocker using a group</a>
 
 <h3>Ideas for accessibility.</h3>
   Add a curve or vector, then double click on the curve or vector to open a dialog box for entering values directly.<br/>
 The Curve dialog is not implemented.<br/>
 The Vector dialog show how you could let users who were visually impared position vectors. The points locations were created in the Animator tool (see the XML). This aproach works for 2D and 3D images.  The issue with this 3D approach is that there are multiple 3D directions that give the same 2D projection.  However, there may be simple workarounds, or maybe it doesn't matter.
